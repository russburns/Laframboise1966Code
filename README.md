# Laframboise1966Code

As part of my senior Honors thesis, I am developing a model to creative predictive Langmuir probe IV curve for given input parameters. To provide an accurate description of the notroiously tricky electron saturation region, I am referencing James G. Laframboise's 1966 well-cited thesis, "THEORY OF SPHERICAL AND CYLINDRICAL LANGMUIR PROBES IN A COLLISIONLESS, MAXWELLIAN PLASMA AT REST". I am also using the thesis to better understand the role of electron sheath expansion. Laframboise's Fortran II Programs "MAIN PROGRAM 2" and "MAIN PROGRAM 3" respectively address those questions. Laframboise addresses the results of several different plasma parameter values, though my analysis assumes the following: 
* Electron temperature distribution (T-) is maxwellian
* Ion temperature (T+) is approximately 0K
* Sheath edge potential is zero
